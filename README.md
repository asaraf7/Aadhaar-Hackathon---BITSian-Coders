# Aadhaar-Hackathon---BITSian-Coders
Repo for sharing solution with UIDAI vide Challenge#3 Address Formatting API

Some noteworthy points:
1. Please find the python code, API Documentation, a short presentation pdf and a Video discussion in this Repo.
2. The API Documentation contains the guidelines on how to use our API.
3. The Jury might want to deploy the API and test its efficacy. They may do so and run the code on their Systems. Otherwise, they may send us their customized input and we will share the output with them.
4. We demonstated the API in the Show & Tell session organised by UIDAI, and tried to implement the recommendations passed in that session. Some of these are in conflict with the discussion held on Forum. Still, we felt that the judgement of Mentor sir in Show&Tell session shall supercede the discussion on Forum.
5. Our Team is available 24*7 to resolve any queries or give any clarification if needed.
6. The URL for the API is a localhost URL. We are waiting for the nod of UIDAI to deploy it to a global URL, which shall be done instantly.
7. A recommendation was given by Mentor sir, that we verify the actual existence of the Formatted Address output, so as to ensure deliveribility of Aadhaar Letter. We have come up with an elegant solution, to use Google Maps API which can return the exact location of the Address, as well as Latitude and Longitude values- which will testify the existence. We will wait for UIDAI's nod to use that in our code, since it Google maps API requires us to create a Billing Account. Other APIs tested by us were not found to be powerful enough!

Thank you:)
